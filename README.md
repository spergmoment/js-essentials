# Welcome to the JS Essentials Repository!
## About
This is a repository I designed to help others out to start learning and using JS!

It's a result of over 3 months of hard work, planning, ideas, and more. I'm very proud of it!

## Getting Started
There are multiple things you may want to check out here:

- [Some old Demonstrations](https://github.com/spergmoment/js-essentials/tree/master/demonstrations-old)
- [A Few Custom Functions](https://github.com/spergmoment/js-essentials/tree/master/functions)
- [The Main Tutorials!](https://spergmoment.github.io/js-essentials/tutorials)

Have fun, and remember to open up an issue to notify me of any mistakes, or make some suggestions.
